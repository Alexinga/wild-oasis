# Wild Oasis

I've created this application using React, React Query, React Hook Form, React Error Boundary, Styled Components, and supabase for the backend

In the Dashboard you are able to:
- Check in your bookings, check out your bookings, delete your bookings, abd sort through your bookings
- Add new cabins, Delete cabins, Edit Cabins, Duplicate Cabins, Sort Cabins
- Create a new user to your database
- Update standard settings for your booking
- Authentication and Authorization into the app
- Update your personal account in the dashboard.
